      "options": ["for", "while", "do-while", "repeat-until"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "C++ has for, while, and do-while loops. 'repeat-until' is not a valid loop construct in C++."

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A destructor is automatically called when an object goes out of scope to clean up resources."

      "question": "Which access specifier allows access from derived classes but not from outside?",
      "options": ["public", "private", "protected", "internal"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Protected members are accessible within the class and its derived classes, but not from outside."

      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Function overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists."

      "question": "Which operator is used to access members of a structure through a pointer?",
      "options": [".", "->", "::", "*"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The arrow operator (->) is used to access members through a pointer."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the correct way to declare a constant in C++?",
      "options": [
        "constant int x = 5;",
        "const int x = 5;",
        "final int x = 5;",
        "readonly int x = 5;"

      "question": "What is the output of cout << (5 > 3 ? 'Y' : 'N');",
      "options": ["Y", "N", "1", "0"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Ternary operator: since 5 > 3 is true, it returns 'Y'."
    },

      "question": "Which header file is needed for string operations?",
      "options": ["<string>", "<cstring>", "<str>", "<strings>"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "<string> header provides the string class in C++."

    {
      "question": "What is the difference between delete and delete[]?",
      "options": [
        "Same",
        "delete for single object, delete[] for arrays",
        "delete[] is faster",
        "No difference"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "delete is for single objects, delete[] is for arrays allocated with new[]."
    },
    {

      "options": [
        "Alias for existing variable",
        "Pointer to variable",
        "Copy of variable",
        "New variable"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Reference is an alias (another name) for an existing variable."

    {
      "question": "Which operator is used to access class members through an object?",
      "options": [".", "->", "::", "*"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Dot operator (.) is used to access members through an object."
    },

      "options": [
        "Class inheriting from multiple classes",
        "Multiple objects of same class",
        "Multiple methods in class",
        "Multiple variables"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple base classes."
