    {
      "question": "What is the output of console.log(typeof null) in JavaScript?",
      "options": ["null", "undefined", "object", "boolean"],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "This is a well-known quirk in JavaScript. typeof null returns 'object' due to a bug in the original JavaScript implementation."

      "question": "Which method is used to add an element to the end of an array?",
      "options": ["push()", "add()", "append()", "insert()"],

        "Checks for equality with type coercion",

      "options": ["let x = 5;", "const x = 5;", "var x = 5;", "variable x = 5;"],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "'variable' is not a valid keyword for declaring variables in JavaScript. Use let, const, or var."
    },

      "question": "What is the output of [1, 2, 3].map(x => x * 2)?",
      "options": ["[1, 2, 3]", "[2, 4, 6]", "[1, 4, 9]", "6"],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element."

      "options": ["JSON.parse()", "JSON.stringify()", "JSON.convert()", "JSON.toObject()"],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "JSON.parse() parses a JSON string and constructs the JavaScript value or object described by the string."

        "A type of error"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) scope even after the outer function has returned."

      "question": "Which of these is the correct way to create an arrow function?",
      "options": [
        "function => (x) { return x * 2; }",
        "(x) => { return x * 2; }",
        "=> (x) { return x * 2; }",
        "arrow (x) { return x * 2; }"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Arrow functions are written as (parameters) => { function body } or (parameters) => expression."

        "Moving code to the server",

      "question": "What is the difference between 'let' and 'var'?",
      "options": [
        "No difference",
        "let has block scope, var has function scope",

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "let has block scope and is not hoisted in the same way as var, which has function scope."
